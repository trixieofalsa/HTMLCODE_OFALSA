        <h2> My HTML Journey from <mark> CHAOS </mark>to <mark> Cat Videos </mark></h2>
        <h3> Or, I accidentally created a self-playing cat video website (and almost lost my sanity) </h3>
        <p> Arned with boundless <em> enthuasiasm </em> and <i> zero coding experience </i>, I embarked on my quest to conquer <mark> HTML </mark>.
            <br>Little did I know, my journey would be less <b> "Lord of the Ring </b> and more <b> "Three Stooges."</b></P>   
        <p> My <ins> first website</ins>, loving named <b> "Brenda's Blossoming Botique" </b>, resembled a digital <mark> Jackson Pollock </mark> painting.  
            <br> Tags were <del> scattered </del> like <em> conffeti </em>, <i> colors clashed </i> like a sunset on <mark> Mars </mark>, and the navigation sysytem could only be 
            <br> described as <b> "whimsical" </b> <sub> (by a very generous browser) </sub>. </p>
        <p> Determine to reedem my self, I tacked a <b> "simple" </b> project <mark> a cat video gallery </mark>. What ansued was a <em> hilarious </em>
            <br> <sup> (and slightly terrifying) </sup> <ins> ballet of misplaced semicolons </ins>, <ins> rougue lines breaks</ins>, and images that dance uncontrollably
            <br> <del> across </del> the screen. At the point my entire website transformed int an <i> auto-playing cat video slideshow </i>, muct to the amusement <sub> (and slight concern) </sub> of my family. </p>
        <p> After <ins> several meltdowns </ins>, <ins> countess tutorials </ins>, and <ins> gallons of coffee </ins>. I finally managed to wrangle my code into <em> submission </em>.
            <br> My cat video gallery wasn't exactly <b> "elegant" </b> , but it functioned <sup> (mostly). </sup> And hey, at least I learned that even the <mark> clumsiest
                coder </mark> can create something...<em> interesting </em>. So here's to 
            <br> <mark> Breanda's Blossoming Boutique </mark>, <mark> <i> the self playing cat video extravaganza </mark> </i> and the <del> never-ending </del> quest to master the art of <b> <mark> HTML </mark>. <b/>
